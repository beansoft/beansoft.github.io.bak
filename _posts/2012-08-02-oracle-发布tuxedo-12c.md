Oracle today announced [Oracle Tuxedo 12c](http://oracle.com/tuxedo), the latest edition of the industry&#8217;s #1 application server for conventional and cloud-based C/C++/COBOL applications.

Optimized to run on [Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/middleware/exalogic/overview/index.html) and tightly integrated with [Oracle Fusion Middleware](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/middleware/overview/index.html), [Oracle Database 11g](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/database/overview/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen&origref=http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/overview/index.htmll) and [Oracle Enterprise Manager 12c](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/enterprise-manager/index.html), Oracle Tuxedo 12c provides mainframe-class scalability and performance for mission critical enterprise applications.

Oracle Tuxedo 12c introduces the new [Oracle Tuxedo Message Queue 12c](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/middleware/cloud-app-foundation/tuxedo/message-queue/overview/index.html), which provides transaction management, enhanced performance and improved availability of enterprise messaging applications.

Oracle Tuxedo 12c delivers innovative features, development tools and product enhancements to help lower the total cost of ownership of existing Tuxedo applications and reduce time-to-market for new application development.

With the introduction of Oracle Tuxedo 12c, along with the new and enhanced Oracle Tuxedo products, Oracle offers the most comprehensive solution for the development, rehosting and deployment of C/C++/COBOL applications in traditional data centers, engineered systems and enterprise clouds.

This release also updates existing Oracle Tuxedo add-on products including: Oracle Tuxedo Application Runtime 12c for CICS, IMS and Batch; [Oracle Tuxedo Application Rehosting Workbench 12c](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/middleware/cloud-app-foundation/tuxedo/application-rehosting-workbench/overview/index.html) ([See related news release on Oracle Tuxedo ART 12c](http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/1721980)); [Oracle Tuxedo System and Application Monitor (TSAM) 12c](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/middleware/cloud-app-foundation/tuxedo/tsam/overview/index.html); [Oracle Services Architecture Leveraging Tuxedo (SALT) 12c](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/middleware/cloud-app-foundation/tuxedo/salt/overview/index.html); [Oracle Tuxedo JCA Adapter 12c](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/middleware/cloud-app-foundation/tuxedo/jca-adapter/overview/index.html); and [Oracle Tuxedo Mainframe Adapters 12c](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/middleware/cloud-app-foundation/tuxedo/tuxedo-mainframe-adapters/overview/index.html).

###### With Oracle Tuxedo 12c Customers Can:

Run Mission Critical, Conventional and Enterprise Cloud C/C++/COBOL, Applications

Achieve increased performance and lowered latency through Oracle Exalogic optimizations: Shared memory for inter-process communication provides an 8x increase in throughput and lowers response time by 80 percent for Oracle Tuxedo applications, irrespective of deployment topology.

Support for multiple application types: Oracle Tuxedo 12c is the only application server that allows for optimized, co-existence of C, C++, COBOL, Java, PHP, Python and Ruby applications.

Dynamic provisioning and automatic scaling in the cloud: Oracle Tuxedo applications can be dynamically provisioned and deployed, and automatically scaled up or down within a private cloud environment.

Improve Operational Efficiency with State of the Art Management

Monitor and manage full application stack: Oracle TSAM 12c is now integrated with Oracle Enterprise Manager 12c, enabling customers to monitor and manage Oracle Tuxedo and its applications, as well as other Oracle applications, from a single console.

Improve productivity and avoid downtime: With business transaction monitoring for cross-product applications and the ability to run more than one version of the same application side-by-side, Oracle Tuxedo 12c reduces diagnostic time and allows application upgrades without system downtime, to help customers maintain a 24&#215;7 operation schedule.

Lower total cost of ownership: New capabilities allow for more efficient workload management across applications based on actual machine usage, within or across domains. Configuration wizards reduce deployment time for new applications.

Accelerate Time to Market with Developer Efficiency Innovations

Enhanced application development capabilities: Customers can develop Oracle Tuxedo applications using Java and leverage the new Oracle Tuxedo integrated development environment plug-in for [Oracle Solaris Studio](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/solarisstudio/overview/index.html) to develop C/C++ applications.

Third-party application integration: Through an easy-to-use configuration tool for deploying Web services, Oracle Tuxedo 12c makes it easy to connect with third-party applications. In addition, it provides a configuration only approach to access Oracle Tuxedo applications from [Oracle SOA Suite](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/soasuite/overview/index.html) through Java Connector Architecture (JCA) based integration.

Enhanced Security: With an enhanced security framework, Oracle Tuxedo 12c applications can be integrated with various security providers to provide improved application security.
