Mar 25, 2011

Today we&#8217;re pleased to announce the immediate availability of both MyEclipse Enterprise Workbench and MyEclipse Blue Edition 9.0. The production releases are built with the most advanced desktop and Web developer technologies HTML5 and Java EE6 with newly added support for JPA 2.0, JSF 2.0, Eclipselink 2.1 and Apache&#8217;s OpenJPA 2.0 release.

With advances in Eclipse open source, we have created a smarter IDE that not only provides the most up-to-date technologies, but has a persistent application lifecycle management (ALM) layer with a collaboration dashboard to make the process of Web and desktop application development an efficient and cost saving endeavor in elastic computing environments.   
For our IBM WebSphere customers, MyEclipse Blue Edition now supports the latest build of WebSphere Portal Server 7.0, as well as WebSphere 6.1, 7 and 8 (beta). IBM&#8217;s popular DB2 series is supported with seamless database integration connectors on both Windows and Linux operating systems.   
Furthermore, MyEclipse Blue Edition integrates ACP versions 1.4, 5 and 6, and client creation against EJB 2.1, 3.0 and 3.1. And, and an advanced application-client XML editor is now included to provide a powerful tool for configuration and change management in XML environments.   
All editions share enhanced integration into the MyEclipse project model and deployment engine so that users have the fastest and cleanest IDE on the market.
