### Free Servlet, JSP, and JDBC Training Material

### From 2nd Edition of _Core Servlets and JSP_ (Volume 1)

#### Chinese Version Translated by Zhao Xueliang

This page gives Chinese (simplified script) translations of the slides from [Core Servlets and JSP, 2nd Edition](http://courses.coreservlets.com/csajsp2.html). Translation by Zhao Xueliang (<Xueliang_Zhao@sonic.com>). 

Slides and exercises from Marty Hall&#8217;s world-renowned [live training courses](http://courses.coreservlets.com) are now available online. The materials on this page are based on the second edition of Marty&#8217;s book _Core Servlets and JavaServer Pages_ and have been tested by Marty in live courses in the US, Canada, Australia, Puerto Rico, Japan, and the Philippines. See the [training materials home page](http://courses.coreservlets.com/index.html) for slides based on _More Servlets and JavaServer Pages_, _Core Web Programming_, the first edition of _Core Servlets and JavaServer Pages_, and online tutorials and conference talks on servlets, JSP, JSTL, Apache Struts, and JSF. Materials in Japanese also available. 

To arrange a servlet & JSP course at _your_ organization based on these materials, again contact <info@coreservlets.com>. These courses can be customized to use any combination of [materials](http://courses.coreservlets.com/index.html), and new materials can be added for specific client needs. They are available in any country, worldwide, but courses outside of N. American usually require more students to justify the travel costs. To learn more details about the instructor, the curriculum for the live training courses, or the public course schedule, please see <http://courses.coreservlets.com>. 

You can also [visit the book&#8217;s home page](http://volume1.coreservlets.com/), [visit the home page of the sequel to this book](http://www.moreservlets.com/) (_**More** Servlets and JavaServer Pages_), or access [the free online version of the book&#8217;s first edition](http://pdf.coreservlets.com/).
