This weeks WebLogic Weekly comes out just as Oracle Open World and JavaOne 2011 are getting up to steam. Expect to see a steady stream of entries in the weekly over the coming weeksas we recap the announcements, exciting news and your comments from this year&#8217;s event. 

**OOW/JavaOne 2011**

Rehashing last week&#8217;s entry which listed a set of key WebLogic Server sessions to attend at OOW and JavaOne 2011: [Showcasing the #1 App Server, WebLogic, at this year&#8217;s OpenWorld and JavaOne](http://blogs.oracle.com/applicationgrid/entry/showcasing_the_1_app_server) by Ruma Sanyal

**Blogs**

Ravish from Middleware Magic provides an example of a WLST script that automatically issues an email alert when a Stuck Thread is detected on a WebLogic Server instance with: [Sending Email Alert For Stuck Threads With Thread Dumps](http://middlewaremagic.com/weblogic/?p=5582). The script generates and attaches a thread dump to the email for analysis.

Over at AMIS, Michel Schildmeijer blogged a short while back about how to add [line editing functionality to the WLST scripting shell](http://technology.amis.nl/blog/12848/weblogic-scripting-tool-command-line-editing). If you spend time working in the WLST scripting shell, this is a very handy tip indeed. Very handy for the Derby IJ shell too I suspect &#8230;

Michael has been busy, with another blog entry showing how to [Extend the WLDF Console](http://technology.amis.nl/blog/13474/oracle-weblogic-extend-your-wldf-console) using an example of observing the CPU time metric of a system running a heavy load for testing.

The NetBeans team have just announced the availability of the NetBeans 7.1 Beta release with some [additional support](http://wiki.netbeans.org/NewAndNoteworthyNB71#WebLogic) for WebLogic Server. They have a small tutorial on their Wiki of the new [MDB/JMS support](http://wiki.netbeans.org/WebLogicJMS) in action.

James Bayer has a very helpful blog stepping through how to set up a simple environment with a [WebLogic Server cluster using Coherence*Web](http://blogs.oracle.com/jamesbayer/entry/coherence_web_with_weblogic_server) to handle HTTP session replication, along with some troubleshooting tips and pointers along the way. We&#8217;ll certainly excuse you for the formatting James, this is knowledge worth sharing even in crayon!

Finally for this week, Oracle announced a [world record SPECjEnterprise2010 benchmark](http://blogs.oracle.com/BestPerf/entry/20110926_sparc_t4_4_specjenterprise2010) result of 40,104.86 SPECjEnterprise2010 EjOPS using WebLogic Server 10.3.5 and the new SPARC T4-4 servers.
