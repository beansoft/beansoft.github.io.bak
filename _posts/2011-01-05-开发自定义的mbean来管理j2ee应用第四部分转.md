内容摘要:

By philippe Le Mouel on September 23, 2010 3:37 PM

Part III was intended to be the final blog entry in this serie of blogs, that demonstrate how to add management capability to our own application using [JMX MBeans](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jmx). However I received several requests regarding notification supports and how it could be added to the sample code we developed so far. This last entry will demonstrate just that. Below is a quick reminder of what we have done so far with associated links:

In [Part I](http://blogs.oracle.com/WebLogicServer/2009/10/developing_custom_mbeans_to_ma.html) we saw:

  * How to implement a custom MBean to manage configuration associated with an application. 
  * How to package the resulting code and configuration as part of the application&#8217;s ear file. 
  * How to register MBeans upon application startup, and unregistered them upon application stop (or undeployment). 
  * How to use generic JMX clients such as [JConsole](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/management/jconsole.html) to browse and edit our application&#8217;s MBean. 

In [Part II](http://blogs.oracle.com/WebLogicServer/2009/11/developing_custom_mbeans_to_manage_j2ee_applications_part_ii.html) we saw:

  * How to add localized descriptions to our MBean, MBean attributes, MBean operations and MBean operation parameters. 
  * How to specify meaningful name to our MBean operation parameters. 
  * We also touched on future enhancements that will simplify how we can implement localized MBeans. 

In [Part III](http://blogs.oracle.com/WebLogicServer/2010/03/developing_custom_mbeans_to_ma_1.html) we saw:

  * How to localize our MBean based on the calling client&#8217;s locale as opposed to the server&#8217;s locale. 
  * How to take advantage of the default resource mapping provided by WebLogic Server to localize MBean descriptions. 
  * How to write a simple client that access our MBean using a locale other than the server&#8217;s locale. 
  * How to set the locale associated with JConsole. 

In this new blog entry we will demonstrate:

  * How to emit an [AttributeChangeNotification](http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/management/AttributeChangeNotification.html) each time a new property is added or changed through our MBean. 
  * How to properly localize our notifications. 
  * How to observe notification using JConsole. 
  * How to write a client that subscribes to the notification emitted by our MBean. 

The complete code sample and associated build files for part IV are available as a [zip file](http://blogs.oracle.com/WebLogicServer/philippe.le.mouel/app_mbean_part4.zip). The code has been tested against WebLogic Server 10.3.3.0 and JDK6. To build and deploy our sample application, please follow the instruction provided in [Part I](http://blogs.oracle.com/mt/mt.cgi?__mode=view&_type=entry&id=15083&blog_id=380), as they also apply to part IV&#8217;s code and associated [zip file](http://blogs.oracle.com/WebLogicServer/philippe.le.mouel/app_mbean_part4.zip).
