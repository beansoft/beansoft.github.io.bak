#### Nomachine – FreeNX fullscreen switching

21 JULY 2007 2 COMMENTS

Something that was not obvious to me when using NX client was the ability to get out of fullscreen. I initially thought that they just hadn’t implemented it as yet.. but we are now on version 3 and I thought that the mere oversight should have been fixed by now.

Well, I don’t know if it has always been there but there’s two ways to switch between the remote desktop session and your local session when using NX

You can switch between full-screen and your original desktop by clicking on the ‘Magic Pixel’ on the top-right corner of your screen. Just move to the top right corner of the screen and left-click.

If, for any reason, your remote session is not responding, you can switch by pressing the sequence ctrl+alt+shift+esc.

Hope this helps..

##### NoMachine Client in Fullscreen

I have recently discovered the machine that is [NoMachine](http://www.nomachine.com/) and am using it to connect to my work computer from outside the office. So far it seems to work really well. The only thing is that I like to run it in fullscreen mode and was struggling to find out how to return to my local desktop. Eventually I found this post [about NX](http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=1187554&postcount=11) which provided all the solutions. In summary the options are: 

Clicking on the top right pixel 
:   Minimises the NX Client and returns you to your client desktop. 

CTRL-ALT-M 
:   Same as above 

CTRL-ALT-T 
:   Brings up a popup asking if I want to terminate the session or just disconnect from it.

Now if only they had a client of Mac OSX which supported fullscreen mode.
